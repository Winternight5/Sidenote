After registering new users will be taken to this page. There are buttons near the top which list their purpose when hovered over.
They include: Settings, New Canvas, New To-Do List and New Note.

This is what will display when user types New Canvas button on User Page.
The user can write freehand on the page, upload a picture, reset the page or make the screen fullpage.
One of the features is Save which will keep the canvas and display it on User page. Once Save is clicked user will be prompt with naming and giving a hash to the item.
